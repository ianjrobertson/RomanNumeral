BYU OIT Coding Challenge - Ian Robertson ianjr@byu.edu

Time taken: 3 hours and 29 minutes

From terminal in RomanNumeral dir run "java main.java"

Included is my handwritten notes "OIT challenge notes" outlining some of my thoughts through the process. I tried to type out some of my thoughts as I was coding as well. 

The most difficult part of the challenge was converting the decimal number to the roman numeral number. My solution was not as elegent as I was hoping for, but it seems to work.
